# Learning Journey (Documentation Work in Progress)

> I love learning new things. Beside actually becoming compentent in a specific discipline I also enjoy the way to get there. What you find here is a central hub to document my learning journey a little for myself. You may find information on specific topics here that you may not easily find on the web otherwise.
