## Strategic Business Goals and IT

An IT auditor should have a strong awareness of the company's operations and objectives. This includes understanding business processes, internal controls and how IT supports the business strategy.

When an enterprise decides on a strategy, achievement of the strategy requires support from a variety of functions across the enterprise. IT plays a two-pronged role:

- Support of the strategy may be with customers.
- Support of the strategy may be through supporting the enterprise's operations.

When an IT auditor performs an IT audit or assessement, the IT auditor provides assurance to the enterprise of IT's contribution to business goals.

## IT Strategic Planning

IT strategic planning is the process of deciding enterprise objectives, changes in these objectives and the policies to govern the development of these objectives, and their execution.

Startegic plans should be fully aligned and consistent with overall enterprise goals and obectives.

Given the strategic plan's alignment with overall business strategy, an IT auditor should understand the importance of strategic planning.

- Management control practices and business assessement plans in the formulation of IT strategy.
- Contents of the strategic plans.
- Requirements for updating and communicating the plans.
- Monitoring and evaluation requirements.
