## What is an Audit

Audits are the formal examaination or testing of information systems to ensure:

- Effective operations
- Compliance with various regulations
- Functioning business operations

Audits are conducted:

- Internally
- Externally

## Purpose of Audits

The purpose of the audit function is to provide the board of directors and senior management independent assurance over the enterprises:

## Strategic Business Goals and IT

An IT auditor should have a strong awareness of the company's operations and objectives. This includes understanding business processes, internal controls and how IT supports the business strategy.

When an enterprise decides on a strategy, achievement of the strategy requires support from a variety of functions across the enterprise. IT plays a two-pronged role:

- Support of the strategy may be with customers.
- Support of the strategy may be through supporting the enterprise's operations.

When an IT auditor performs an IT audit or assessement, the IT auditor provides assurance to the enterprise of IT's contribution to business goals.

## IT Strategic Planning

IT strategic planning is the process of deciding enterprise objectives, changes in these objectives and the policies to govern the development of these objectives, and their execution.

Startegic plans should be fully aligned and consistent with overall enterprise goals and obectives.

Given the strategic plan's alignment with overall business strategy, an IT auditor should understand the importance of strategic planning.

- Management control practices and business assessement plans in the formulation of IT strategy.
- Contents of the strategic plans.
- Requirements for updating and communicating the plans.
- Monitoring and evaluation requirements.

## Three Lines Model

## Topic Summary

- The audit function develops and implements a risk-based IT audit strategy complying with IT audit standards based on the goals and objectives established through the governing body.
- Auditors independently and objectively ensure that management's actions are aligned with the established enterprise objectives.
- The audit charter defines and documents the purpose, authority, responsibility, and accountability of the IT audit function.
- IT auditors play a critical role in providing assurance to the board and senior management about IT's contribution to business goals.
- Under the Three Lines Model, management, the governing body, and internal audit have distinct roles and responsibilities that better enable strong governance and management.

# Module 1, Topic 2: Organizational Independence and Internal Enterprise Relations

## Learning Objectives

- Explain Organizational Independence and how it applies to the audit function.
- Describe relationships that auditors have with enterprise functions and oversight activities such as governance, risk management, compliance and information security.
- Explain IT department roles and responsibilities.

## Orginizational Independence

Audit services should be managed to establish and maintain organizational independence of the audit function. 

Independence represents:

- Self-Governance
- The freedom from conditions that threaten objectivity or the appearance of objectivity

This independence may be supported when the audit function:

- Reports to a level within the enterprise that provides independence enabling the IT audit function to perform its responsibilities without interference.
- Discloses the details of the impairment to the appropriate parties if independence is impaired.
- Does not perform non-audit roles in IT initiatives that require assumption of management responsibilities.
- Addresses independence and accountability of the audit function in its charter or engagement letter.

## Enterprise Function Relationships

The IT auditor must understand three important enterprise functions: Risk Management, Compliance, and Information Security.

<strong>Risk Management</strong>

Risk Management ins the discipline by which an enterprise in any industry assesses, controls, exploits, finances and monitors risk from all sources for the purpose of increasing the enterprise's short and long-term value to its stakeholders.

The management of risk must:

- Balance the operational needs of the business against the need for effective controls, while maintaining productivity.
- Evaluate risk across the entire enterprise, not just system-wide or department-wide.
- Identify the IT-related business vulnerabilities and assess their impact upon stakeholders.

<strong>Compliance</strong>

Compliance applies to the adherence to, and the ability to demonstrate aherence to, mandated requirements defined by laws and regulations, as well as voluntary requirements resulting from contractual obligations and internal policies.

Compliance issues are a concern of the board and include issues of:

- Data governance
- Data privacy and protection
- Operational risk
- Information Security

The IT auditor should review legislative and regulatory requirements pertaining to the access and use of IT resources, systems and data to assess whether IT assets are effectively protected and whether associated risk is managed.

When determining an enterprises level of compliance with external requirements an IT auditor should be aware of:

- Government or other relevant external requirements.
- Applicable laws and regulations.
- External requirements that affect business plans and enterprise policies, standards, procedures and business application.
- IT department activities that address adherence to laws or regulations.
- Enterprise procedures that address these legal and regulatory compliance requirements.
- Contracts or agreements with external IT service providers that require legal or regulatory requirements related to services provided.

<strong>Information Security</strong>

Information security ensures that within the enterprise, information is protected against disclosure to unauthorized users (confidentiality), improper modification (integrity), and non-access when required (availability).

Information security exists to support and further the business objectives of the enterprise by managing risks to limit disruptions to acceptable levels. To accomplish this objective, all enterprise processes must be assessed and the appropriate security requirements applied to minimize disruptions and achieve the business objectives.

The IT auditor is responsible for the evaluation of information security policies, standards and procedures to ensure:

- Completeness
- Alignment with generally accepted practices
- Compliance with applicable external requirements

IT audit can help to determine information security deficiencies from a controls and compliance standpoint and are one of the essential resources in strategy development.

## Topic Summary

- The IT audit functions should be independent of the area or activity being reviewed to allow objective completion of the audit and assurance engagement.
- An IT auditoir must be aware of the purposes, responsibilities, and roles surrounding the various stakeholders in the enterprise as applied to IT-related activities.
- The IT department includes a range of roles from hardware and software deployment to internal support and even incident response.
- IT auditors must understand risk management, compliance and security functions within the enterprise.

# Module 1, Topic 3: External Relationships

## Learning Objectives

- Articulate the difference between internal and external audit and how the two functions work together.
- Describe how the audit function uses the work of other auditors and experts.

## External Audit Firm Relationships

An IT audit function often maintains relationships with entities outside an enterprise. These relationships
may be with:

- An IT auditor from an external firm.
- A management consultant.
- An expert in the engagement area appointed by senior management or team.
- Government regulators.
- Compliance program assessors.

An external audit firm typcially provides many services and may include:

## Comparison of Internal and External Assurance Reviews

|Characteristics    | Internal Audit | External Audit |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
|Independence Requirements|Independence of internal auditors should be established, verified and maintained | Independence of the external auditors should be establiehd, verified and maintained |
| Interested Party | Executive management, audit committee, operational management and enabler owners involved | Primarily directed toward the board / shareholders, but of importance to the enterprise in general |
|Responsible Party | Management and business enabled owners involved | The board and executive management involved |
| Assurance Provider | Internal Auditor | External Auditor
| Reporting Format and Requirements | Internal consistency required, in line with professional standards | Highly regulated / standardized |
| Governing Rules/Standards | Standardized approaches based on good practices. Professional standards of ethics required | Adherence to applicable codes of ethics and professional standards required |
| Level of Trust | Medium - Depends on the skill and expertise of the internal audit function and opn the cooperation of the accountable party | Maximum - The skill and expertise of the external auditor is an essential requirement of all audit assignments

## External IT Audit Scope

If IT audit services are provided by an external audit firm:

- The internal audit function should be independent.
- The scope and objectives of these services should be documented.
- The internal audit function should report to an audit committee.

The external audit team may rely on internal audit functions of an enterprise. The relationship should be described in the audit charter or engagement letters. This relationship should be documented in detail. Considerations may include, but not be limited to, how:

- Work will be coordinated to minimize duplication of effort.
- Audit docuemtnation and evidence will be shared.
- Work planned by the external auditors will affect the audit plan for the coming period.


## External Authors, Protocols and Considerations

When a part, or all of IT audit services are proposed to be outsourced to an external provider, the following should be considered when using the services of other auditors and experts:

- Restrictions on outsourcing of audit/security services provided by laws and regulations.
- Audit charter or contractual stipulations.
- Impact on overall and specific IT audit objectives.
- Impact on IT audit risk and professional liability.
- Independence and objectivity of other auditors and experts.
- Professional competence, qualifications, and experience.
- Scope of work proposed to be outsourced and approach.
- Supervisory and audit management controls.
- Method and modalities of commuinication of audit work results.
- Compliance with legal and regulatory stipulations and professional standards.
- Testimonials / references and background checks.
- Access to systems, premises and records.
- Confidentiality restrictions to protect customer-related information.
- Use of computer-assisted auditing techniques (CAATs) and other tools.
- Standards and methodologies for performance of work and documentation.
- Nondisclosure agreements.

## External Audit Objectivity and Independence

It is the responsibility of the IT auditor or enterprise employing audit services to do the following:

1. Clearly communicate audit objectives, scope and methodology through a formal engagement letter.

2. Establish a monitoring process (of the external audit firm) regarding planning, supervision, review and documentation. Review the work perfomed and reports issued by external IT auditors or experts to confirm that:

- Scope has been met.
- Significant assumptions have been identified.
- Findings and conclusions have been agreed to by management.

3. Assess the usefulness and appropriateness of the work and reports of external IT audit providers and assess the impact of significant findings on the overall audit objectives.

If the work of other experts does not give adequate and acceptable audit evidence, an IT auditor should perform additional test procedures based on their assessment of the work of other experts.

An IT auditor should assess whether additional testing or re-performance of other experts' work is necessary.

## Topic Summary

- Internal auditors may have a narrower focus on providing assurance to enterprise departments while external auditors can provide special expertise and a broad view of the enterprise.
- Together, internal and external auditors provide independent and objective assurance across a broad range of focus areas such as risk, compliance and enterprise governance.
- Internal auditors assess the usefulness and appropiateness of the work and reports of external IT audit providers and the impact of significant findings on the overall audit objectives.
