### The CIA Triad

- Confidentiality - relates to permitting authorized access to information, while at the same time protecting information from improper disclosure.
- Integrity - the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose.
- Availability - means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them.

### CIA Definitions

| Term | CIA Topic | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Personally Identifiable Information (PII)| Confidentiality | Pertains to any data about an individual that could be used to identify them.
| Protected Health Information (PHI) | Confidentiality | Information regarding one's health status. |
| Classified or sensitive information | Confidentiality | Includes trade secrets, research, business plans and intellectual property.
| Sensitivity | Confidentiality | A measure of the importance assigned to information by its owner, or the purpose of denoting its need for protection. |
| Data Integrity | Integrity | Assurance that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.|
| System integrity | Integrity | Refers to the maintenance of a known good configuration and expected operational function as the system processes the information.|
| State | Integrity | Current condition of the system.
| Baseline | Integrity | Can refer to the current state of the information - whether it is protected. Then, to preserve that state, the information mus talways continue to be protected through a transaction. |
| Criticality | Availability | Represents the importance an organization gives to data or an information system in performing its operations or achieving its mission. |

### Non-repudiation

Non-repudiation is a legal term and is defined as the protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action. It provides the capability to determine whether a given individual took a particular action, such as created information, approved information or sent or received a message.

> Think: Making a purchase online. Non-repudiation methologies ensure that people are held responsible for transactions they conducted.

### Privacy

Privacy is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves. While security and privacy both focus on the protection of personal and sensitive data, there is a difference between them. With the increasing rate at which data is collected and digitally stored across all industries, the push for privacy legislation and compliance with existing policies steadily grows.

here are several laws that define privacy and data protection, which periodically change. Ensuring that protective security measures are in place is not enough to meet privacy regulations or to protect a company from incurring penalties or fines from mishandling, misuse, or improper protection of personal or private information. 

An example of a law with multinational implications is the European Unionâ€™s <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> which applies to all organizations, foreign or domestic, doing business in the EU or any persons in the EU. Companies operating or doing business within the United States may also fall under several state legislations that regulate the collection and use of consumer data and privacy. Likewise, member nations of the EU enact laws to put GDPR into practice and sometimes add more stringent requirements.
