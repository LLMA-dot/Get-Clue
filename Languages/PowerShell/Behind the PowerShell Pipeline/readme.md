## What is this?

Behind the PowerShell Pipeline is a premium subscription blog by Jeffrey Hicks himself explaining concepts in-depth. I've been subscribed for a while now and really enjoy his writing style and train of thought (which I also enjoyed from reading his books).

I recommend the subscription if you are working with PowerShell on a daily basis.

The code in this repo is not going to do much for you - buy the subscription to get access to all the explanations.
