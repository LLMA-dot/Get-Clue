# Account Reconciliation

The primary function of reconciliation is to verify that actual access aligns with approved access, as previously described. Many organizations have implemented specific processes for access review and reconciliation. The following three questions address several key elements within the process that should be reviewed:

# Does repeatable and reliable reconciliation occur?

Management should review performance of reconciliation processes to determine if they are sustainable and repeatable. In additiona, management should review these processes to determine their reliability. For example, is the process actually generating measurable improvement in the state of logical access control? Simply reviewing the logicial access and stating that it is appropriate is not enough.

Many large organizations have encountered the "rubber stamp" review, in which the person responsible for performing the review, stamps an approval on the entitlement report, as a result of the person's inability to deal with the amount of users he or she is responsible for reviewing. Because the review process could be thought of as a form of identification validation, the person performing the review should have some knowledge of the person for whom they are vouching (i. e. to state that an individual needs to have access to an application). If the process is such that the individual validating access cannot possibly know all the users, the process needs to be made more effective. One possibility in this situation is to have lower-level managers conduct the reviews of their direct reports, rather than having a more senior individual review those with whom he or she rarely interacts.

# How often do reconciliations occur?

Many organizations perform reconciliation reviews twice a year. However, once automation is involved, the process could be performed almost daily with any exceptions being automatically repaired or reported to the individuals responsible for managing access.

# How are reconciliations handled?

To answer this question, management should ask the following:

- What happens when a reconciliation event occurs?
- Is the event simply logged for later review?
- Do the systems automaticially reconfigure to align with what should be?
- What steps are taken to identify the root cause of the problem?
- Is the event only a technology problem or did someone make an unauthorized change to a system?
