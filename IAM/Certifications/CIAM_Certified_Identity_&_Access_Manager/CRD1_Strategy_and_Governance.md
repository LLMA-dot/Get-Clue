## IAM Overview

<strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong> is the information security discipline which is concerned with user and device access to an organization's resources. It refers to a set of business processes and technologies that support the creation, maintenance and deactivation of a digital identity and related access rights.

> As organizations better understand and embrace IAM, they know how an effective identity management program with entitlement management and enforcement of logical access controls can help them achieve benefits, such as low operating costs derived from centralization, automation, as well as effective and efficient processes to address delayed processing, high costs associated with access provisioning or de-provisioning, excessive access and compliance challenges.

Benefits include:

- Leverage technology to automate
- Address system access in a coherent manner across the enterprise
- Realize higher return on investment
- Reach business goals
- Meet user and compliance demands
- Make processes more efficient
- Reduce risks

### Key Terms and Concepts

- <strong>Identity</strong> - is comprised of unique elements that describe a person or machine. An identity is recognized by a system in many ways including with something the user knows, such as a password or a personal identification number (PIN); something the user has, such as an ID card, key fob or a badge; and something the user is, such as a fingerprint or retinal pattern; or any combination of these elements.
- <strong>Access</strong> - is the information representing the rights that an identity is granted.
- <strong>Entitlements</strong> - is the collection of access rights.

The concept of identity and access management refers to human identity, as well as machine identities, service accounts and other non-human identities that must be managed.

For identities to become part of an organization and access management cycle, they need to pass through several stages which include:

<strong>1. Provisioning</strong> - Creation, Change, Termination, Validation, Approval, Propagation and Communication.
<strong>2. Identity Management</strong> - refers to ongoing companywide activities including the establishment of an IAM strategy, administration of IAM policy statement, changes, establishment of identity and password parameters, management of manual or automated IAM systems and processes and periodic monitoring, auditing, reconciliation and reporting of IAM systems.
<strong>3. Enforcement</strong> - refers to authN, authZ and logging of identities as they are used within the organization's IT systems though (primarily) automated processes or mechanisms.

### Additional Terms and Concepts

- <strong>Access Management</strong> - The proccesses associated with a user's login across a realm of applications or information repositories.
- <strong>Authentication</strong> - The process of validating that people or entities are who they say they are.
- <strong>Authorization</strong> - The process of determining if a user has the right to access a service or perform an action.
- <strong>Single Sign-On</strong> - A central authN protocol that allows users to log-on once and access all systems and data for which they have AuthZ.
- <strong>Credential</strong> - An Item such as a username/password combination.
- <strong>Directory Service</strong> - Software System that stores, organizes and provides access to information in a directory for entities such as people, groups, devices, resources, etc.
- <strong>Federation</strong> - Technical Implementation that enables identity information to be developed and shared among several entities and across trusted domains. Also known as Federated Identity Management.
- <strong>Governance</strong> - Processes, tools and people which allow organizations to manage user identities and their access while meeting compliance and managing risks.
- <strong>Identity Management (IdM)</strong> - The processes and solutions that provide for the creation and management of user information also known as IdM.
- <strong>Identity Provider (IdP)</strong> - System that validates the identity of a user in a federated system. The service provider (or SP) uses the IdP to get the identity of the current user.
- <strong>Identity Store</strong> - Underlying information associated with users and stored across a variety of technologies including databases, LDAP, Active Directory, text files etc.
- <strong> Access Administrator</strong> - A person who assigns roles, group memberships and/or other attributes to a user.
- <strong>Service Provider (SP) </strong> - A resource or system that provides a generic service to the user in a federated system. To users, a service provider is the same thing as the application they are trying to use.
- <strong>User</strong> - A term used to generalize and reference multiple entities which access a system such as employees, guests, application users and external users such as customers, contractors and vendors.
