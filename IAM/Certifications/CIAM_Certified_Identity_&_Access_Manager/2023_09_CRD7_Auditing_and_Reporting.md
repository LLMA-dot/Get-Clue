## Auditing

To evaluate the design and effectiveness of an organization's IAM system, periodic auditing of the process is necessary. Audit frequency should be determined as part of the annual audit planning process, which stems from internal audit's annual risk assessement. 

Consider the following scope:

- A re-examination of the IAM process design and documentation.
- An examination of the IAM process operating effectiveness.
- A review of the provisioning process, which encompasses the evaluation of a sample of identities representing a cross-section of those that were active for any portion of the audit period.
- An examination of IAM enforcement activity effectiveness.
- An examination of IAM administrative activity effectiveness.

## Reporting

Different types of reports need to be created and used for audit purposes. Many of the reports that are typically created are used for operational purposes, such as reports of system performance activities, tasks and queue management functions, and reconciliation events. Audit reports include those that describe:

- Lists of identities and their associated access.
- The person approving access for specific information.
- The management of group and supervisory accounts.
- The number of users accessing a particular application or information resource.

Additionally, the process and supporting systems should be able to provide reports that detail access approvals and reviews, because these are areas of frequent weakness that are uncovered when auditing an organization's identity and access management process.

## Audit Process

The first step in the IAM audit process is to determine whether the company has an IAM program. This can be determined by asking the following questions:

- Are there policies in place for managing and administering user identities and access activities?
- Is there a strategy in place for addressing the risks associared with the IAM process?
- Is there a reference model the organization can use during the administration process?

When answering these questions, it is important to identity whether documentation already exists that addresses these issues to some degree. In addition, when assessing a company's IAM posture, internal professionals need to identify and consider key IT and Non-IT elements.

Below is a list of elements that are not entirely centered in technology:

- Business objectives and governance
- Business unit and management alignment with business objectives
- Understanding existing laws and regulations
- Budgets and resources
- Implementation plans, IAM program
- Defining how technology can enable a more effective control environment

Before developing an IAM audit approach or assisting with the creation of IAM processes, any existing identity management policies and procedures should be reviewed.

In addition to conduring a risk assessement, internal professionals can assist management or the identity management team in determining where new or additional team members should come from within the organization.
