# Certification Roadmap

What follows is a documentation of my exam prep. Note that this is not what I recommend to you; simply documenting my own progress. You may be a lot faster or you may need more time. It always depends how much time you are able to devote to the topic.

## My Study Materials

Check the current exam objectives [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-500). These do change frequently and I will not keep them updated unless I am working on a re-certification.

### Learning Paths on Learn.Microsoft.com

The learning paths on Microsofts homepage are really good. They will not get you all the way to exam-ready, but I've always found them to be a solid foundation for what you need to learn and to find your weakest areas for the exam. They also also updated constantly with new topics of the exams.
