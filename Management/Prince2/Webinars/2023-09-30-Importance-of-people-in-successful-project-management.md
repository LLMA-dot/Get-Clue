## Key Takeaways

> Why are people so important in projects?

- Projects are DONE BY people
- Projects are DONE FOR people
- Projects are DIRECTED and MANAGED by people
- Projects bring CHANGE, and change affects people DIRECTLY

### Principles 01: Continued Business Justification

> CONTINUED BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION: Reason for the project is recorded and approved, and is REVALIDATED throughout the life of the project.

- Business justification needs to satisfy ALL main stakeholder groups.
- Business justification may be perceived differently by different parties.
- Demonstrating benefits achieved to data motivates people.

> Communicate COMPELLING VISION for the future state.

> Stimulate ONGOING COMMUNICATION between stakeholders about business reason, value, and benefits.

### Principles 02: Learn From Experience

> A PRINCE2 project teams learns from experience: lessons are sought, recorded and acted upon throughout the life of the project.

> Perform RETROSPECTIVES and introduce IMPROVEMENTS - as often as possible.

Before we plan next steps, we review what we did already. What happened thus far? What can we learn from it?

> Create MENTORING and ON-THE-JOB-TRAINING opportunities, as well as simple and user-friendly TOOLS for capturing and applying lessons.

### Principles 03: Defined Roles and Responsibilities

> A PRINCE2 project has defined and agreed roles and responsibilities within an organization structure that engages the business, user and supplier stakeholder interests.

- CLEAR team structure
- Defined Responsibilities
- Everybody knows WHAT TO EXPECT from others
- Business, user and supplier communities COLLABORATEW to achieve project objectives

> Conduct a THOROUGH STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS prior to defining communication management approach.

> Make project structure, lines of reporting, and assignment of responsibilities EASY TO USE, VISIBLE, and ACCESSIBLE for all.

### Principles 04: Manage by Stages

> A PRINCE2 Project is planned, monitored and controlled, stage by stage. The project board DELEGATES the AUTHORITY FOR DAY-TO-DAY CONTROL of a management stage, within agreed tolerances, to the project manager.

- DIVIDE project into "PIECES" helps everyone stay focussed.
- Stage boundaries provide GOOD POINTS FOR REVIEW, restructuring, and improvements (Milestones)
- Planning stage by stage enables to INVOLVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE in defining the details of work and products.

> Check and ensure that the overall project direction is still VALID, and people are COMMITTED to it.

> Conduct THOROUGH REVIEW of TEAM STRUCTURE, and responsibilities at each stage boundary, with improvements in mind.

### Principles 05: Manage by Exception

> A PRINCE2 project has defined TOLERANCES for each project objective, to establish limits of DELEGATED AUTHORITY.

- Tolerances enable DELEGATION and EMPOWERMENT - decisions are made as low as it is possible.
- Delegating leaves a lot of space for upper levels to conduct LEADERSHIP ACTIVITIES.
- Escalating tolerance breaches SECURES main parties interests when decision may have an IMPACT on them.

> Exceptions come from the very nature of the projects - use them as an OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE, discuss and learn.
> Adjust tolerance ranges and EMPOWER PEOPLE more when confidence and TRUST improves during a project.

### Principles 06: Focus on Products

> A PRINCE2 project focuses on the DEFINITION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS, in particular their quality requirements.

- Focusing on products allows for EXCHANGING DIFFERENT VIEWS.
- Product-focused approach facilitates appropriate response to CHANGING NEEDS of the users.
- Ensures SMOOTH ADOPTION.

> Establish EFFECTIVE RELATIONSHIPS with user community to ENGAGE USERS at each step of quality planning and control.

> Use scope and quality tolerances to enable CONSTANT ADAPTATION to the evolving needs and expectations for a project product.

### Principles 07: Tailor to suit the Project

> PRINCE2 is TAILORED TO SUIT the project environment, size, complexity, importance, TEAM CAPABLITY and risk.

- Tailoring enables the PRINCE 2 method TO BE ADAPTED to the needs of people involved.
- Tailoring is all about making people's MANAGEMENT EFFORT appropriate.

> Do not try to adapt people to the method, instead think how to TAILOR THE METHOD TO THE PEOPLE in your team, taking into account their CAPABILITIES and overall PM maturity.
> People's UNDERSTANDING of the PRINCE2 method WILL INCREASE over time - don't be too strict and let people learn to apply it.
