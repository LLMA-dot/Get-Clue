## Control Environment Assessement 

Risk is more severe when:

- Controls are inadequate
- The wrong controls in use
- Controls are ignored or bypassed
- Controls are poorly maintained
- Logs or control data are not reviewed
- Controls are not tested
- Changes to control configurations are not managed
- Controls can be physically accessed and altered
- Control objectives are not appropriately defined
