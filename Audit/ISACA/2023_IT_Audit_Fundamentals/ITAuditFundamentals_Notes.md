# Module 2, Topic 1: Internal Controls and Control Types

![Controls](./_IMG/M2T1_Controls.png)

## Control Environment Assessement 

Risk is more severe when:

- Controls are inadequate
- The wrong controls in use
- Controls are ignored or bypassed
- Controls are poorly maintained
- Logs or control data are not reviewed
- Controls are not tested
- Changes to control configurations are not managed
- Controls can be physically accessed and altered
- Control objectives are not appropriately defined

# Module 2, Topic 3: Risk-Based and Agile Audit Approaches

![M2T3 - Risk Based Auditing](./_IMG/M2T3_Risk_Based_Auditing.png)

### Enterprise Risk Assessment Purpose

![M2T3 - Enterprise Risk Assessment Purpose](./_IMG/M2T3_Enterprise_Risk_Assessment_Purpose.png)

### Establishing Risk Criteria

![M2T3 - Establishing Risk Criteria](./_IMG/M2T3_Risk_Criteria.png)

### IT-Related Risk Assessement

Meaningful IT-related risk assessments and risk-based decisions require:

- Expressing IT-related risk in clear and business-relevant terms.
- Involving major stakeholders to articulate impacts from adverse events.
- Understanding impact and resulting losses from IT-related issues.
- Considering effect on ability to deliver key products and services.
- Repearing regularly to remain relevant.

### Agile Audit Approach

> Applying an agile approach begins as a shift away from a static plan.

- PRIORITIZATION: Audit areas evaluated are picked based on risk. Timely inclusion of new risk or auditable areas allowed. Collaboration with stakeholders critical.
- SEGMENTATION: Breaking activities into fixed-length. Goal is to be quick and iterative instead of confined to a predetermined plan.
- COMMUNICATION: Embedding quality reviews and opportunities for staff questions as they come up.

### Audit Risk and Influences

- INHERENT RISK: Susceptibility of an audit area to an error that could be material.
- CONTROL RISK: Risk that a material error exists that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the system of internal controls.
- DETECTION RISK: Risk that the IT audit will not detect an error that could be material, individually or in combination with other errors.
- OVERALL AUDIT RISK: Probability that information or financial reports may contain material errors. 

### Limiting Audit Risk

![M2T3 Limiting Audit Risks](./_IMG/M2T3_Audit_Risks.png)

### Topic Summary

- A risk-based auditing approach provides the enterprise with feedback on whether its operational practices are aligned with its risk appetite.
- An agile approach to auditing is adaptable as audit expectations change, providing flexibility in the execution of an audit plan.
- Audit risk is the risk of reaching an incorrect conclusion based on audit findings drawn from collected information containing material errors that may go undetected during the audit.
- Audit risk can be reduced by conducting the appropriate assessments while planning and performing the IT audit and extending the control tests or procedures to gain additional assurance where higher materiality exists.

# Module 3, Topic 1: Audit Expectations

## Audit Process Phases

![Audit Process Phases](image.png)

## Management Assertations

Board of Directors and senior management responsibilities:

- Confirming the enterprise has the appropriate IT resources.
- Implementing IT systems and controls.
- Ensuring IT sustains and extends enterprise strategies and objectives.
- Protecting the enterprise information resources.
- Ensuring the accuracy of information.
- Complying with applicable regulations.

> Senior Management makes assertations while meeting these responsibilities.

### Assertation:

- Formal declarations about the subject area written by management.
- List of specific attributes about the subject matter or related processes included.

### IT Auditors:

- Consider these assertations throughout the audit.
- Test their validity.
- Obtain assurance on their achievement.
- Address them in the audit report.

### Common Examples of Assertations:

- COMPLETENESS: Records all activities, information and other data that should have been recorded.
- ACCURACY: Amounts, dates and other data related to recorded activities were recorded appropriately.
- INTEGRITY: Information, evidence and other data received come from trustworthy, reliable sources and are protected throughout their life cycles.
- AVAILABILITY: Information, evidence and other data required for an audit exist and are readily accessible in the change management tracking application.
- COMPLIANCE: Information, evidence and other data are recorded according to the enterprise, regulatory or other applicable stipulations.
- EFFICIENCY: The level of performance used allows the lowest number of inputs to create the greatest number of outputs.
- EFFECTIVENESS: The desired output or objective is produced.
- CONFIDENTIALITY: Preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure.

### Assertion Availability and Quality

> Before an audit, an IT auditor should ensure:

- Management fully understands its responsibility to provide all required information.
- Assertations are consistent with good practice.
- Assertions are reviewed for an IT audit to confirm they are sufficient, valid, can be tested and relevant to the audit.

> If management cannot provide required information:

- Inform IT audit management and governance bodies of their identified issue.
- Postone the IT audit.
- Determine an appropriate course of action based on the level of risk if they do perform the IT audit.

## Auditor Expectations

![Auditor Expectations](./_IMG/M3T1_Auditor_Expectations.png)

> Objectivity: The ability to exercise judgement, express opions and present recommendations with impartiality.

Impairment: Exists when either objectivity or independence is absent.

Examples of Impairment:

- Scope limitations
- Restrictions on access to records, personnel, equipment or facilities
- Resource limitations

> Fraud is the crime of using dishonest methods to take something valuable from a person or enterprise.

### Topic Summary

- The audit process phases are audit planning, fieldwork and documentation, and reporting and follow up. Each phase has distinct tasks to perform.
- Senior management provides assertations related to their subject area of responsiblity and are excpected to provide all required information regarding the subject matter and the assertions made.
- An IT auditor considers assertations provided by management throughout the execution of an IT Audit, tests their validity and obtains assurance on their achievement to addresses in the audit report.
- Auditors should expect to have a sufficiently defined scope and to perform their work in accordance with ethical standards and guidelines of the profession.
- During an audit, an IT auditor may encounter instances of fraud or criminal activity. It is crucial to understand the circumstances and the impact of this activity to determine the appropriate response.

# Module 3, Topic 2: Types of Audits

An IT auditor should understand the various types of internal and external audits and trhe basic audit procedures associated with each. Different types of audits performend by the audit function may include the following areas:

- IT
- Financial
- Operational
- Integrated
- Compliance
- Administrative
- Specialized

An IT audit is designed to evaluate whether internal controls implemented by management provide reasonable assurance that:

- Business, operational and control objectives are met.
- Undesired events will be quickly prevented or detected and corrected.

![Operational and Administrative Audit](./_IMG/M3T2_Operational_and_Administrative_Audit.png)

## What is an Integrated Audit?

> Process focused on risk whewre multiple appropriate audit disciplines are combined to assess key internal controls over an operation, process or entity.

![Integrated Audit](./_IMG/M3T2_Integrated_Audit.png)

## Topic Summary

- An IT auditor should understand trhe various types of audits that can be performed, internally or externally, and the basic audit procedures associated with each type.
- There are many different types of specialized audits that can be conducted to evaluate third-parties and software or detect and investigate criminal acts or fraud.
- Integrated audits are risk-focused and combine multiple audit disciplines, such as financial, operational and IT audit procedures, to assess key internal controls over an operation, process or entity.
